# Rubber-ducky-using-arduino-leonardo-pro-micro
An Arduino Script that exploits the ability of an 
Arduino leonardo board to act as an HID device 
(A keyboard in this case). The script types the 
necessary keystrokes to download Netcat and connect
to the specified ip and the port number and hence get
a reverse shell on the attackers system.
